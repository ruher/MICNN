# MICNN: Multi-input convolutional network

Code used in paper “Multi-input convolutional network for ultrafast simulation of field evolvement”.

Model code (model.py) is partly adapted from [Implementation of UNet](https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet).

Accompanied datasets can be downloaded from Mendeley Data: XX

## Dependencies

  Tensorflow 2.1.3 and Python 3.6.

## How to use

Please find README under each folder, for details on how to preprocess raw data, train and test CNN, and reproduce the results in the paper.
