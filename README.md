# MICNN: Multi-input convolutional network

Code used in paper “Multi-input convolutional network for ultrafast simulation of field evolvement”.

Multi-input CNN model code (model.py) is partly adapted from [Implementation of UNet](https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet).


## Dependencies

  Tensorflow 2.1.3 and Python 3.6.
  
## Data

Accompanied datasets can be downloaded from Mendeley Data: XX

## How to use

### Fluid dynamics

1. Run **dataPreprocess160.py** to prreprocess 30 groups of raw vorticity data under //data file.
2. Run **
